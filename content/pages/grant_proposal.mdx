## Technical Implementation

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

class AssetTwin(BaseModel):
    name: str
    type: str
    location: str
    status: Optional[str] = "operational"
    metadata: Optional[dict] = {
        "industry": "",
        "criticality": "high",
        "maintenance_schedule": "adaptive"
    }

@app.post("/api/v1/twins/register")
async def register_twin(asset: AssetTwin):
    """Register an industrial asset as a digital twin"""
    # Production features:
    # - OAuth2/JWT authentication
