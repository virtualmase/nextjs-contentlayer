## What is Operon

Operon provides:
- **Digital Twin Technology:** High-fidelity virtual replicas of assets, processes, and environments for simulation, optimization, and predictive maintenance.
- **Self-Evolving AI:** Continuous learning from real-time and historical data to optimize operations, predict failures, and recommend improvements.
- **Open Source Core:** Transparent, auditable, and extensible foundation for industry-specific integrations and compliance.
- **Secure by Design:** OAuth2/JWT authentication, RBAC, encrypted data, and audit logging.
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Easily extend the platform with custom analytics, AI models, and integrations.

## Consent & Data Privacy

We are committed to protecting your privacy and data. Operon AI only collects the minimum information necessary to provide and improve our services. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. You control your data and can request deletion at any time.

## Information We Collect

- Device and asset metadata (for digital twin registration)
- Operational telemetry (for analytics and optimization)
- User authentication and access logs (for security and compliance)

## How We Use Your Information

- To provide digital twin and AI-driven operational insights
- To improve system performance and reliability
- To ensure security, compliance, and auditability
- To support user requests and platform enhancements

## Integration Quickstart

Here's how to register an industrial asset as a digital twin using our open API:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends, HTTPException, status
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Optional

app = FastAPI()

def get_current_user():
    # In production, validate JWT and RBAC here
    return {"username": "admin", "role": "admin"}

class AssetTwin(BaseModel):
    name: str
    type: str
    location: str
    status: Optional[str] = "operational"
    metadata: Optional[dict] = {}

@app.post("/api/twins/register")
def register_twin(asset: AssetTwin, user=Depends(get_current_user)):
    if user["role"] != "admin":
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authorized")
    # In production, store in database, trigger Kafka, audit log, etc.
    return {"message": f"Digital twin '{asset.name}' registered.", "twin": asset.dict()}
```
